<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5px;">Hi I'm Cherry, and I am a passionate learner, as well as a student researcher, in machine/deep learning. I tend to devote myself to projects that are meaningful and do good to the community.

My goal is to demonstrate that deep learning systems are capable of much more than they can do today especially when they are combined with other fields, such as formal mathematics, quantum chemistry, and compiler optimization.

People lead me to believe that open source based research (with rigorous code reviews), versus paper based research, is the future and will benefit the entire community.. Feel free to have a look. I dumped a lot of text here, enjoy your stay and use the content at your own risk!</p>
